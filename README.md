ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System
------------------------------
Recommender systems are algorithms designed to suggest relevant items to users based on their preferences, behaviors, or interactions. They help users discover content by automatically filtering and prioritizing information from vast item collections.

Recommendation systems work by analyzing user behavior such as ratings, clicks, and purchases. They identify patterns to match users with similar users or items with similar items, and then use this information to predict what the user might want next.

These systems are important because they help reduce information overload, enhance user engagement, and drive key business outcomes such as sales, retention, and content discovery.
Common use cases include e-commerce, streaming platforms, social media, and personalized news.

There are several types of recommender systems, each using different methods to generate suggestions.

Content-based filtering recommends items similar to those a user liked in the past, based on item attributes such as genre, brand, or description.

Collaborative filtering makes recommendations by finding patterns in user-item interactions. Types include user-based filtering (users with similar preferences) and item-based filtering (items liked by similar users).
