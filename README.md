üé¨ Movie Recommendation System
------------------------------
Recommender systems are everywhere from Netflix to YouTube to online shopping. This project helps us understand how those systems work behind the scenes. By building a movie recommendation system, we're learning how to handle real world data, apply machine learning concepts like similarity and filtering. It‚Äôs a fun and practical way to explore data science and build something people can actually use.

In this notebook, we're going to look at how content-based recommendation systems work and create a simple example using Python and the Pandas library.

Content-Based Recommendation Systems: These systems suggest items to users by looking at what they like. The recommendations are based on the user's preferences, interests, or things they‚Äôve rated highly in the past. Basically, it tries to find similar items to the ones the user has already shown interest in.
