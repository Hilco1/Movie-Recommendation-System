🎬 Movie Recommendation System
------------------------------
Recommender systems are everywhere from Netflix to YouTube to online shopping. This project helps us understand how those systems work behind the scenes. By building a movie recommendation system, we're learning how to handle real world data, apply machine learning concepts like similarity and filtering. It’s a fun and practical way to explore data science and build something people can actually use.
