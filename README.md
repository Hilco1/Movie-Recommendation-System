üé¨ Movie Recommendation System
------------------------------
Recommender systems are algorithms designed to suggest relevant items to users based on their preferences, behaviors, or interactions. They help users discover content by automatically filtering and prioritizing information from vast item collections.

**Recommendation systems** work by analyzing user behavior such as ratings, clicks, and purchases. They identify patterns to match users with similar users or items with similar items, and then use this information to predict what the user might want next.

These systems are important because they help reduce information overload, enhance user engagement and satisfaction, and drive key business outcomes such as increased sales, improved customer retention, and better content discovery. Common use cases include product suggestions in e-commerce, movie and music recommendations on streaming platforms, friend and content suggestions on social media, and personalized news or article feeds.

There are several types of recommender systems, each using different methods to generate suggestions. 

**Content-based filtering** recommends items that are similar to those a user has liked in the past. This approach relies on item attributes such as genre, brand, or description. For example, if a user enjoyed the movie Inception, the system might suggest another science fiction thriller.

**Collaborative filtering** makes recommendations by identifying patterns in user behavior, focusing on user-item interactions like ratings or clicks. This method includes two main types: user-based filtering, which finds users with similar preferences, and item-based filtering, which identifies items liked by similar users. An example would be, ‚ÄúUsers who bought X also bought Y.‚Äù

**Hybrid systems** combine both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. The goal is to take advantage of the strengths of each method while minimizing their individual limitations. For instance, Netflix uses a hybrid approach that incorporates both a user‚Äôs viewing history and metadata about the content to make more accurate recommendations.
