üé¨ Movie Recommendation System
------------------------------
Movie recommendation systems are algorithms or tools designed to suggest films to users based on various types of data. Their goal is to help users discover movies they are likely to enjoy, without having to search extensively. These systems are widely used by platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime.

These systems are everywhere from Netflix to YouTube to online shopping. This project helps us understand how those systems work behind the scenes. By building a movie recommendation system, we're learning how to handle real world data, apply machine learning concepts like similarity and filtering. It‚Äôs a fun and practical way to explore data science and build something people can actually use.
